# WebApi
<h1>This is the backend of the ClientApi</h1>
There is also a client side whichi is written in Angular 9, it's just a CRUD projet to test this web api. The backend is a sql server data base
so you need <b>SQL Server to be installed</b>.<br><br>
There are two controllers <b>LivreController</b> and <b>VisiteurController</b> which implement <b>CRUD</b> operations.
</br></br>
So to start the projet you need <b> to generate the database first</b>, there is a script <b>Biblio.sql</b> so after having sql server 
execute the sql scrript.<br><br>
Also dont forget <b>to change the connectionstring to fit your server name</b> because certainly it will be different to the mine
you have change it in both classes <b>Startup.cs</b> and <b>BiblioDbContext.cs</b> so be aware.<br><br><br><br>
